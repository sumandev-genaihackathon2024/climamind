3.1 Introduction
Flood is a temporary inundation of large regions as the result of an increase in
reservoir, or of rivers flooding their banks because of heavy rains, high winds,
cyclones, storm surge along coast, tsunami, melting snow or dam bursts. Floods are
characterized as any high stream flow which overlap natural or artificial banks of a
river or a stream and are markedly higher than the usual: a n d the inundation of low
lands. Sometimes copious monsoon rains c o m o l n e d with massive oufflows from the
rivers cause devastating floods. Flooding is caused by the inadequate capacity
within the banks of the rivers to contain the high flows brought down from the upper
catchment due to heavy rainfall. Areas having poor drainage characteristics get
flooded by accumulation of water from heavy rainfall. Flooding is accentuated by
erosion and silting of the river beds resulting in reduction of carrying capacity of river
channel, earthquakes and landslides leading to changes in river courses,
obstructions to flow, synchronization of floods in the main and tributary rivers and
retardation due to tidal effects.
I n order to circumvent flood havoc, including flash flooding, preparation of an

emergency action is the need of the hour, comprising the activities as listed below
3.1.1 The Action Plan consists of the following activities:
1 . Identifying the main elements at risk;
2 D e c l a r a t i o n o f F l o o d disaster;
3. Flood Forecasting and Warning:
4. Trigger mechanism; and
5. Response mechanism of the concerned line departments alongside
the tasks responsibilities of the official machinery.
3.1.2 Elements at Risk
Anything in the flood plains wil get inundated. Buildings built of earth, weak
foundatlons and water soluble materlals will collapse endangering human beings
and their property. Utilities like sewerage, water supply, communication lines, and
power are put at risk. Food stock i n the godowns (storage houses), agricultural
fields, salt pans, livestock, vehicles, machinery a n d e q u i p m e n t ' s mounted on the
ground, fishing boats are also put at risk.
3.1.3 H a z a r d Z o n e s
According to Andhra Pradesh State Development Planning Society, the flood
hazard zones for river Godavari are East and West Godavari; for Krishna river, it is
Guntur and Krishna; for Pennar river the district affected is Nellore; and rivers
Vamsadhara a n d Nagavalli affect Srikakulam district. The problem is intensified by
factors like silting of riverbeds, reduction of carrying capacity of river channels,
beds and banks leading to changes in river courses, obstructions to flow due to
landslides, synchronization of floods in the main and tributary rivers and retardation

is estimated that 44% of AP's total territory is vulnerable to tropical storms and
related hazards, while its coastal belt is the most vulnerable, especially the area
covering more or less the entire coastal region. Along the coastline, the secilon
between Nizampatnam and Machilipatnam is most prone to storm surges. The
fertile Delta areas of the Godavari and Krishna rivers, which contribute substantially
to the State's agricultural economy, experience recurrent flood and drainage
problems.
Besides natural surges a n d outflow of waters from streams a n d rivers, floods are
c a u s e d by p e a k discharges. As part of AP Hazard Mitigation a n d Emergency
Cyclone Recovery Project (CERP), the Andhra Pradesh State Remote Sensing
Application Center (APSRSAC), the Department of Statistics and Planning, GoAP,
had prepared several 100-year return perlod maps for all major river systems by the
Revenue (Disaster Management Il) Department of GoAP in 2010. With a coastline of
974 kilometers, AP had experienced over 103 cyclones and resulting floods in the
last century.
Devastating Tungabhadra Floods (2009)
The October-November 2009 floods in AP, occurred in Kurnool District which lles
on the southern banks of Tungabhadra as well as Handri rivers. Normally, the
river course receives small discharge up to 50,000 cusecs. However, by October
02, 2009 the river had received 2, 00,000 cusecs resulting in flood water entering
the flanks of the river and Inundating 80% of Kurnool town and surrounding
areas. Similarly, the capacity of Tungabhadra river course was 4,00,000 cusees.
Mantralayam in Kurnool District along with other towns were severely affected
due to the floods, a combined total of 87 Mandals: 525 villages were affected.
which includes Kurnool, Mahbubnagar (now in Telangana State) and other
An estimated 20.72 lakh people were affected due to the floods. Incessant rains
and inevitable discharges from upstream reservoirs of Narayanpur and
Tungabhadra dams were one of the primary reasons of unprecedented
Inundation in Kurnool and Mahbubnagar districts between 30th September
and 3rd October 2009.
3.2 Declaration of Flood Disaster
The Andhra Pradesh Disaster Management Rules(2007) provide for the State
Government to declare any area, where floods have occurred or likely to occur as
a disaster affected area on the recommendations of the Commissioner, Disaster
Management (Revenue) Department (CDM) or the concerned District Collector
(s). The purpose of the declaration is to organize effective response in mitigating the
flood effects. Such a declaration provides for wide powers a n d responsibilitles to
the CDM and the District Collectors in order to handle the incident effectively.
3.3 Flood Forecasting and Warnings
Flood forecasting is a process whereby the authorities are alerted to impending
conditions where floods are likely occur. Flood forecasting requires understanding
of meteorological and hydrological conditions and is therefore the responsibility of
the appropriate government agencles such as IMD and Central Water
Commission, they provide early warning in co-ordination with State Government
Agencies such as Irrigation Department,

3.4 Community Based Flood Forecasting & Warning Systems
It Is important that the p e o p l e in e a c h community receive Information as early as
possible about the possibility of flooding in their area. In addition to the valuable
information from the official flood warning system, communities should attempt to
develop their own warning systems. At community level, it is important that
warnings a r e r e c e l v e d b y all individuals. The w a y in which messages are
disseminated in communities will depend on local conditions, but may include
some or all of the following devices:
a. Media warnings (both print and electronic)
b. General warning indicators for e.g.. sirens, fire crackers, drum beating.
etc., could be used
C. Warnings delivered to areas by community leaders or emergency
s e r v i c e s
d. Dedicated automatic telephone warnings to at-risk properties
Information about flooding and flood conditions in communities
upstream. One approach to disseminating messages is to pass warning
messages from village to village as the flood moves downstream
Keep watch and b e regularly Informed about the river level and
embankment conditions in the local area. The monitoring of the river
a n d e m b a n k m e n t should b e i n c r e a s e d as t h e w a t e r level i n c r e a s e s a n d
crosses the critical danger level
g. A community-based warning system to pass any information about an
approaching flood to every family.
f. Communities to be involved in d a t a collection for flood forecasting, and
the importance of their role is vital to reduce risk of flooding to
communities. They could take c a r e of installations/equipment, r e a d rain
a n d water level record, Radio operators to report real-time observations
and provide info to the concerned aufhorities on time.
3.5 Procedure for Disseminating Warnings to Remote Areas
The communitles in remote areas may not be able to recelve the types of warnings
described in the previous section. Responsibilities need to b e d e fi n e d clearly for
lower tiers of administration a n d t h e e m e rg e n c y services to h a v e pre d e fi n e d links
with communities in r e m o t e areas. This should include:
(a) Local Radio, which should b e supplied with clear and accurate
i n f o r m a t i o n
(b) Use of appointed community wardens with direct two-way Radio or
Mobile Telephone access to warning agencies and emergency
a u t h o r i t i e s
(c) Local means of raising alarms, for example church/temple bells, PA
System, sirens, loud hailers, loud speakers, etc. The latter could b e the
responsibillty of selected Individuals or w a r d e n s , w h o n e e d t o b e
provided with equipment a n d transport, for example motor cycles or
bicycles;
(d) 'Sky Shout' from emergency service helicopters.
(e) Doordarshan & local cable channels (TV & Radio Channels including FM
Radio)
(f) HAMRadios
(g) Press Bulletins
(h) Satellite b a s e d Disaster Warning Systems
Fax. Telephone and Mobile Communications, etc.
3.6 Trigger Mechanism: Plan Activation
The flood response system will b e a c t i v a t e d on the o c c u r r e n c e of a h e a v y rain. The
Commissioner, Revenue (DM) wil a c t i v a t e all the Departments for e m e r g e n c y
response including the State EOC. The department will Issue instructions to include
the following details:
(a) Specify exact resources required
(b) The type of assistance to be provided
(c) The time limit within which assistance is needed
(d) The State, District or Other contact persons/agencies for providing
a s s i s t a n c e
(e) Other Task Forces with which coordination should take place
The State EOC a n d other control rooms at the state level as well as district control
rooms should be activated with full strength. The GoAP may publish a notification in
the Official Gazette declaring such locations to be disaster-affected areas under
APSDM Rules (2007). O n c e the situation is totally controlled a n d normalcy is
restored, the Revenue, (DM) declares "End of Emergency Response" and issues
instructions to withdraw the staff deployed on emergency duties.
3.8 Role & Responsibilities of Departments at the District
3.8.1 Revenue Department
The Revenue Department at all levels in the State will b e responsible for response
and relief operations. It should prepare a vulnerability analysis for all villages. The
district gulde lists out all the villages located on river banks and were subjected to
floods in the past with other defalls.
The d a t a should b e u p d a t e d o n c e in six months. It should earmark teams for rescue
and evacuation, opening of shelters or relief camps, arranging transport for teams,
warning public and disseminating information to al the concerned about relief
operations / plans including non-governmental organizatlons taking part in the
operations or likely to take part on arrival from outside the district.
Reception and briefing arrangements for the Army deployed for rellef work should
b e arranged besides providing them with maps and/or guides. Organize relief
camps, e m e rg e n c y feeding, clothing a n d household supplies a n d provision of
temporary shelter assistance wherever necessary. They should also arrange for air
dropping of food packets and water sachets in marooned and isolated villages.
3.8.2 Irrigation Department
The moment a heavy rain and flood warning is given by the IMD or the CWC, the
Irrigation Department should arrange for patrolling of flood banks. It should keep
sand bags in sufficient numbers wherever needed to plug breaches. If should lower
the water level in reservoirs on time according to the impending rainfall.
3.8.3 Roads & Buildings Department
As m a n y national highways pass through cities a n d villages, the Roads a n d
Bulldings Depariment should keep a list of road points which are prone to
Inundation and culverts which are weak and likely to overflow. Immediately after
floods, i f should estimate damages and carry ouf repairs. Ifs immediate fask is to
ensure that traffic is not interrupted a n d no relief activity is affected. Besides this, the
department should also estimate damage to buildings, if any, and submit it to the
authorities concerned. It should also keep helipads ready for flood relief operations.
3.8.4 Police Department
The Police Department Is responsible for law and order, protection of property,
helping in evacuation, assisting in search and rescue operations, providing
required number of radio sets with operators and positioning mobile VHF sets as per
district plans. It should ensure speedy delivery of messages received and help in
disposal of the dead, if any. During floods and heavy rains, the Police should also
ensure that no trucks and buses cross causeways and bridges especially when the
streams and rivulets a r e in spate, especially when they are under water. Quite
often, vehicles are washed away when they ply on causeways and bridges under
w a t e r.
3.8.5 Information Department
The District Public Relations Officer should e d u c a t e public o n flood hazards a n d the
steps they should take. It can do this through local newspapers, posters and
handbills. It can exhibit posters at prominent public places such as bus terminals,
railway stations, post offices and cinema halls. People should b e advised to listen to
All-india Radio bulletins made avallable by the Information & Public Relations
Department. Slides on important aspects of "Dos" and "Don'ts" should be shown in
cinema halls. Community radlo sets should be checked by Sarpanch/ execuilve
officer / village secretary / headmaster of elementary school. The PRO should also
carry out media liaison release approved information for publication / telecast.
3.8.6 Medical & Health Depariment
The District Medical and Health Officer is responsible for providing emergency
medical treatment to flood victims, maintenance of public health, checking the
quality of drinking water and maintaining sanitary conditions. It should train
selected volunteers in villages in first aid, coordinate utilization of medical teams,
medical supplies and a m b u l a n c e s a n d issuance death certificates, etc.
3.8.7 Education Department
Flood rellef should be included in school curriculum. School and college buildings
should b e m a d e avallable for relief camps. The c a m p s should h a v e an a d e q u a t e
number of toilets and water. Schools and colleges could also b e used for organizing
a w a r e n e s s c a m p s .
3.8.8 Electricity
As Disaster Preparedness Measures suggest, power lines a n d installations a r e to b e
kept free from obstructions. They should maintain power supply at the best possible
level during floods, particularly at relief camps and hospitals/treatment centers,
adopt public safety measures for installations d a m a g e d and provide generators.
3.8.9 Forest Depariment
The Forest Department should b e ready to procure and supply material such as
b a m b o o s a n d p a l m leaves for temporary shelters especially in slum areas.
3.8.10 Transport Department
The Reglonal Transport Officer or the Deputy Commissioner (Transport) should
provide the required number of vehicles as per allocations m a d e by the Municipal
Commissioner. Data of available transport in the district should be maintained.
3.8.11 Posts & Telecommunications Depariment
It should provide additional telephones for rellef operations as requested by the
Municipal Commissioner a n d ensure rapid repair of d a m a g e d
t e l e c o m m u n i c a t i o n s .
3.8.12 Training of Government Officials
Al officers likely to be drafted for flood duty should be trained. At the moment,
organizations. like Administrafive Training Institutes (Alls) are organizing regular
courses on disaster m a n a g e m e n t .
3.9 Relief Measures
3.9. 1 Short Term Relief Measures
a) Food & Nutrition
In an extreme flood situation, people lose standing crops and stored food grains. In
such cases, free distribution of foods shall be m a d e to avoid hunger a n d
malnutrition. Wherever is possible, dry rations should be distributed for home
cooking.
b) Water
Water supply is Invariably affected in natural disasters. Availability of safe drinking
water is very challenging particularly during floods. It must be ensured that affected
p e o p l e have a d e q u a t e facilities a n d supplies to collect, store and use clear a n d
safe water for drinking, cooking and personal hygiene.
c) Health
During post-disaster phase, many factors increase the risk of diseases and
epidemics because of overcrowding, Inadequate quantity and quality of water,
poor environmental and sanitary conditions, decaying biological matter, water
stagnation a n d i n a d e q u a t e shelter& food supplies. There should b e a d e q u a t e
supply of medicines, disinfectants, fumigants, etc., to check outbreak of
epidemics. It should be ensured that the medicines have not reached expiry date.
d) Clothing & Utensils
The people affected by the disaster shall be provided with sufficient clothing,
blankets, etc. to ensure their safety and well-being. Each disaster affected
household shall be provided with cooking and eating utensils.
e) Shelter
In case of flood, a large number of people are rendered homeless. In such situations
shelter becomes a critical factor for survival and safety of the affected population.
In vlew of this, flood affected people, who have lost their houses shall be provided
sufficient c o v e r e d s p a c e for shelter. Disaster a ff e c t e d households shall b e provided
with necessary tools, equipment a n d materials for repair, reconstruction and
maintenance for safe use of their shelter.
f) Relief camp
Relief camps also provide good temporary arrangements for people affected by
flood. Adequate number of bulldings or open space should be identified where
relief camps c a n b e set u p during emergency. The requirements for operation of
relief camps should be worked out in detail in advance. The temporary relief camps
should have adequate provision of drinking water and bathing, sanitation and
essential health-care facilities.
g) Sanitation and Hygiene
Sanitation services a r e crucialto prevent a n outbreak of epidemics In the post-
disaster phase. Therefore a constant monitoring of any such possibilities needs to be
c a r r i e d o u t . It s h o u l d b e e n s u r e d t h a t d i s a s t e r a f f e c t e d h o u s e h o l d s h a v e a c c e s s f o
sufficient hygiene measures.
3.9.2. Interim Relief Measures
a) Arrangements to be made for quick identification and maintenance of the
records of disposal of dead bodies in the affected areas (Home Dept., Revenue
Dept., Health Dept. and Local Authorities).
b) Arrangements to be made to record the complaints of all persons reported
missing. Follow u p action in terms of verification of the report also needs to b e
made (Home Department)
c) District Magistrates and Sub-Divisional Magistrates to be empowered to
the requirement of identification and post-mortem in case of
mass casualties. Revenue Dept may depute additional Sub-Divisional
Magistrates to expedite disposal of the dead bodies (Revenue & Home
Departments)
d) Unclaimed/ unidentified dead bodies to be disposed of with help of pre-
identified voluntary agencies at the earlest after keeping their records. (Home,
Revenue, Health Departments & Local Bodies)
e) Additional manpower to be deployed in the affected areas for supplementing
the efforts of the local administration (General Administration Department
(GAD)).
Separate Cell to be established at State/District/Mandal levels to coordinate
with the NGOs and donor/ aid agencies. (Revenue Department)
g) Regular Meetings of the different stakeholders/departments should be
organized at state level for sharing information, developing strategies for relief
operations. (Commissioner, Disaster m a n a g e m e n t & Collectors at the District
Level)
h) Information & Public Relations Dept to coordinate with the media to play a
positive role In disseminating appropriate information to public and the
government in order to facilitate the speedy recovery (1&B Department).
3.9.3 Assessment of Damage/ Loss and Relief Needs
The Commissioner, Revenue (DM) to issue instructions to the District Collectors to
provide the "Need Assessment Report". The Revenue (DM) should consolidate
the same and to prepare the State's "Need Assessment Report".
b) The Commissioner, Revenue (DM) to issue Instructions to the District Collectors to
provide the "Damage and Loss Assessment Report". The Commissioner, DM to
consolidate the same and to prepare the State's "Damage and Loss
Assessment Report" which wil be useful in planning and implementing the relief
operations for disaster victims.
Revenue Department)
d) the Relief Need Assessment Report should be provided by the Collectors to
GoAP (Commissioner. DM. fornecessary action)
e) Identification and demolition of dangerous structures in the affected areas to
minimize further loss of life a n d injuries. (R & B, Revenue Departments a n d Local
Bodies)
f) Arrangements for distribution of gratuitous rellef a n d c a s h doles. (Revenue

The S E O C a n d o t h e r c o n t r o l r o o m s a t t h e s t a t e l e v e l a s w e l l as district c o n t r o l r o o m s
should be activated with full strength. The State Government may publish a
notification in the official gazette, declaring such area to be disaster-affected area
under APSDMA Rules of 2007. Once the situation is totally controlled and normalcy
is restored, the Commissioner Revenue (DM) declares End of Emergency Response
and issues instructions to withdraw the staff deployed in emergency duties.
3.10 Other Important Concerns at the District and below Levels
3.10.1 People's Participation
As we involve people in development projects right from the planning stage
through participatory methods, w e could d o t h e s a m e in the c a s e of Disaster
Management. Officials could discuss flood disaster in wards also. They could also
discuss the subject in SHG groups. Women, being the managers of houses, could
play a key role during disasters.
3.10.2 Awareness Campaigns
A campaign should be launched to promote awareness of disasters and people's
participation in meeting them. It should cover people, elected representatives of
local bodies, institutions, students, w o m e n groups, NGOs a n d local political leaders.
The Information & Public Relations Department, with the help of media, Is most
suited for this purpose. This awareness campaign should be taken up in all
vulnerable villages. Once the public, the concerned officials and volunteer groups
are fully aware of the repercussions of floods, they would be prepared to face
them. Disaster Management (DM) Teams can be formed from among the
category of persons identified above. One amongst them could b e selected as a
t e a m l e a d e r .
3.10.3 N e e d s A s s e s s m e n t
The DM Teams should be able to Identify the resources available at ward level and
Immediately after the floods. Such d a t a avallable for ward should b e included in
ward / division resource record. The record will be useful in identifying resources that
h a v e to be brought from outside the ward / mandal. Such assistance c a n b e
quantifled a n d requisitioned.
3.10.4 Preparedness Plan
Having achieved this, the DM Team can translate Its awareness into preparedness
by enlisting participation of all sections of society. It Is important that women
members i n the team are consulfed as they give useful suggestions particularly
affecting women and children. An action plan has to be drafted based on ideas
g a t h e r e d over a series of mutual discussions: The plan should Ilst out the actions to
be carried out by various persons at specified time periods and list the resources
(both h u m a n a n d material) to be used.
3.10.5 Potential for Reducing Hazard
Embankments along the rivers, sea walls along the coasts may keep water away
from the flood plains. Water flow can be regularized through construction of the
reservolis, c h e c k dams, alfernate d r a n a g e channels/routes, and Increasing
vegetation cover and by providing storm drains.
3.11 Main Mitigation Strategies
3.11.1 Mapping of the Flood-prone areas
This is a primary step involved in reducing the risk of the region. Historical records
give the indication of the flood inundation a r e a s a n d the period of occurrence a n d
the extent of the coverage. The basic m a p is c o m b i n e d with other m a p s a n d d a t a
to form a complete image of the flood plain. Warning can be issued looking into the
earlier marked heights of the water levels in case of potential threat. In the coastal
areas the tide levels and the land characteristics will determine the submergence
areas. Flood hazard mapping will give the proper indication of water flow during
floods.
3.11.2 Land use control
This wil reduce danger of life a n d property w h e n waters inundate the floodplains
and the coastal areas. The number of casualties is related to the population in the
area at risk. It's better to reduce the densitles in areas where neighborhoods are to
b e developed. In a r e a s where p e o p l e already h a v e built their sefflements,
measures should b e taken to relocate to better sites so as to r e d u c e vulnerability.
No major development should be permitted in the areas which are subjected to
high flooding, Important facilities should be bullt in safe areas. In urban areas, water
holding areas can b e created in ponds, lakes or low-lying areas.
3.11.3 Construction of engineered structures
Construction activity in the flood plains and strengthening of structures to withstand
flood forces and seepage is the sine qua-non. The bulldings should be constructed
on an elevated area: and, If necessary bulld on stilts or platform,
3.11.4 F l o o d C o n t r o l
I t aims at reducing flood damage. This c a n b e done by Flood Reduction by
decreasing the a m o u n t of runoff by treatment like reforestation (to increase
absorption could be a mitigation strategy in certain areas, protection of
vegetation, clearing of debris from streams and other water holding areas,
conservation of ponds and lakes etc. Flood Diversion includes levees,
embankments, d a m s and channel improvement. Dams can store water and can
release water at a manageable rate. Flood Proofing reduces the risk of damage.
Measures include use of sand bags to keep flood water away, blocking or sealing
of doors and windovs of houses etc. Houses may be elevated by building on raised
land. Buildings should be constructed away from water bodies.
3.11.5 Flood Management
Flood management comprises both structural a n d non-structural measures.
Structural measures include storage reservoirs, flood embankments, d r a i n a g e
channels, anti-erosion works, channel improvement works, detention basins etc.
Non-structural measures include flood forecasting, flood plain zoning. flood
proofing, disaster preparedness etc. The flood m a n a g e m e n t measures undertaken
so far have provided reasonable degree of protection to an area of 15.81 million
hectares throughout the country.
3.11.6 Community Based Flood Disaster Mitigation
Apart from the sustained efforts by the government and experts to bring about
s p e e d y recovery soon after the flooding, It Is the responsibility of the local
community that plays a vital role in mitigating the sufferings at the grassroots
through its active involvement in several different ways. Sedimentation clearance,
reforestation program, dike and flood wall construction can be taken as part of the
community based mitigation program. The community could be capable of
participating in flood fighting by organizing work partles to repair embankments,
p l e sandbags a n d stockpile needed materials. Farming practices h a v e to b e flood
compatible. Special varleties of seeds are available which c a n b e harvested
during the flood season. Houses constructed need to be flood resistant and multi-
purpose shelters should b e constructed by the community. Banks of the earth can
be raised and it can give shelter to the community as well as the livestock during the
time of floods.
